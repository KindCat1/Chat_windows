# Chat
This is a chat for Windows computers that are in one local net. One of them runs `server.exe` and all of them run `client.exe`
## Another files that should be on your computer
- Client    
Near the `client.exe` you should put an `icon.ico` file (you can copy it from the repository)
- Server     
Near the `server.exe` you should put an `db.json` file, which content should be `{}`
## Developer information 
- Client      
The client of the messenger was written in Python using urllib and tkinter. After that I compiled it using pyinstaller. 
- Server      
The server was written in Python using flask. After that I compiled it using pyinstaller.

Thanks to [IconArchive](https://iconarchive.com) for icons for my files.
